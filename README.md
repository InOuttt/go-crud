## Getting Started

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) is also needed if you want to try the kit without setting up your
own database server. The kit requires **Docker 17.05 or higher** for the multi-stage build support.

After installing Go and Docker, run the following commands to start experiencing this starter kit:

```shell
# download the starter kit
git clone https://github.com/inouttt/go-crud.git

cd go-rest-api

# start a PostgreSQL database server in a Docker container
make db-start

# seed the database with some test data
make testdata

# run the RESTful API server
make run

# or run the API server with live reloading, which is useful during development
# requires fswatch (https://github.com/emcrisostomo/fswatch)
make run-live
```
